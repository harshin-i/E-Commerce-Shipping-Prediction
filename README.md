# E-Commerce Shipping Prediction

Predict whether an online order will be delivered on time using machine learning.

---

## 📘 Project Overview

With the growth of e-commerce, timely delivery is critical for customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. This project aims to build a predictive model that classifies orders into **“on time”** or **“delayed”** based on features like product details, shipping mode, and customer location.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Develop and evaluate a machine learning model for delivery punctuality prediction.  
- Provide insights and predictive capability to logistics teams to help reduce late deliveries.

---

## 🧠 Key Features & Capabilities

- Data cleaning, preprocessing, and handling missing values  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
- Feature engineering, encoding categorical variables  
- Model training with multiple algorithms (e.g. Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)  
- Model evaluation with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score  
- Ability to make predictions on new/unseen data
